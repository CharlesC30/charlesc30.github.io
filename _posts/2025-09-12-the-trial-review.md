Recently I went on a trip to Cape Cod with my family. While there we visited a local book store where I was determined to get something to read (or at least start reading) during the trip. In the literature section I noticed a book called The Trial by Franz Kafka. I had heard of Kafka before and was familiar with his general vibe, but I never read anything of his so decided to buy The Trial and give it a go.

I ended up loving the book and finished it sometime early last week. Since I also recently started this blog I decided writing a review would be a fun way to collect my thoughts on the book and encourage anyone who stumbles on this post to give The Trial a try.

**Warning:** I will not be avoiding spoilers in this post/review. If The Trial does sound at all interesting I would encourage you to read the first chapter and see how you feel. If you like it then you will probably like the rest of the book as well, if not that's a good indication the book isn't for you and I think you can safely put it down.
