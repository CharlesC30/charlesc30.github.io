Hello! Welcome to my first blog post. I want to use this post to layout my goals for this blog, and discuss the tooling I used to create it. 

My goal for this blog is to provide a place for me to highlight and discuss any projects I work on in my free time. Over the past 
year I've started several small projects which could make good blog posts. Whether I decide to retroactively add those projects as posts remains to 
be seen, but at least now I will have a venue to discuss any projects I start in the future. 

I may also use this blog to showcase non-technical things from my life too. This could include book reviews or highlights from my other hobbies like playing guiter and hiking. 

Now to discuss the tooling I'm using to make this website and blog. I've had this website up for a few months and used it as an opportunity to build my web development skills, therefore I wrote the main website in pure HTML/CSS. I was also inspired by the simple design of Jonathan Lam's website (https://lambdalambda.ninja/) and wanted to create a similar aesthetic. 

The site is hosted using Github Pages. I've been really impressed with how easy and seamless it is to host a personal website with Github Pages, and it does seem to be the go-to hosting platform for anyone with programming experience.

The decisions to write my website in pure HTML/CSS and host with Github Pages really determined the tooling I decided to use for this blog. At first I tried out Pelican (https://getpelican.com/), since it's written in Python (my main-stay programming language) and I am a big fan of Thomas Caswell's who uses it for his blog (https://getpelican.com/).
But in the end it proved very difficult to keep my existing formatting and styles with Pelcian, since they seem to really want you to use a Pelican theme rather than simple HTML/CSS.

So I decided to go with Jekyll instead (https://jekyllrb.com/). I hesitated to use Jekyll at first since it's a Ruby program and I have never used Ruby and didn't really want to install another high-level scripting language on my system (I already had Python, Perl and Node.js), but so far it's been great. Jekyll works well with regular HTML files and renders them as-expected, plus Github Pages is powered by Jekyll so the integration there was totally seamless.
