            Hi! Here's some information about myself
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Professional background</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am computational researcher with a background in data visualization, algorithm development, and machine learning applications. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a M.Sc. degree and a B.E. degree from <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>. 
            While at Stony Brook I did research computational materials science research at the nearby <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/">National Synchrotron Light Source II</a> (NSLS-II), and completed a thesis on 
            <a href="Charles_Clark_MS_Thesis_as_submitted.pdf"><i>X-ray Data Processing & Visualization Techniques for Analysis of Functional Materials</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finishing my thesis I moved to Germany for a year where I worked as a Research Assistant (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) at the University of Stuttgart's 
            <a href="https://www.iti.uni-stuttgart.de/en/chairs/cis/">Computational Imaging Systems</a> (CIS) department. My research focused on applying deep learning models to artifact correction
            in undersampled 3D computed tomography (CT) images. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I was offered to stay longer in Germany, I decided to move back to the U.S. at the end of my research contract. Since moving back I have been actively searching for roles
            where I can continue using my skills to advance scientific research, including positions in data science, scientific computing, and research software engineering. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <u> Personal/Misc. information</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in the Buffalo, New York area, and am currently living there again since I left Germany. <br>
            In my free time I enjoy working on personal coding projects including physics simulations and game development. <br><!--(see <a>projects page</a> for more details). -->
            Other hobbies include: playing guitar, disc golf, and hiking
        </p>
