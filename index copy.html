    Some of my past projects include:
    <ul>
        <li>An investigation of deep learning techniques for artifact correction in sparse-view computed tomography (CT) imaging. 
            Led to presentations at the 2024 and 2025 International Conferences on Industrial Computed Tomography 
            (see corresponding publications <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.58286/29243">here</a> 
            and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.58286/30720">here</a>).

            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NSLS-II-ISS/xview/blob/main/xview/xview_dash.py"><i>XDash</i></a>, a web application for visualization and analysis of synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy datasets.
            Created as part of software development internship at Brookhaven National Lab.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            A survey of state-of-the-art methods for visualization and processing of synchrotron X-ray data for functional materials analysis, compiled in my 
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="assets/Charles_Clark_MS_Thesis_as_submitted.pdf">master's thesis</a>.
